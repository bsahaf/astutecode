# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Basim and I study Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I originally come from Kashmir, a place in the Himalayan Mountains, and moved to Canada in 2016 for my undergraduate studies. It was in my middle school that I started fiddling around with my computer by creating basic websites in HTML and publishing content on Blogger. I often say that that time was my Eureka period which made me pursue Computer Science. 

In the past two years, I have learnt a lot of new things about Computer Science through my courses, hackathons and personal projects. I am currently working on a project called Polygon, originally a hackathon idea on which I have been adding features since then. It helps businesses expand smartly and efficiently by providing an analysis utilizing open data. The code is open sourced and you can find it [here](https://github.com/TeamPolygon). I learnt and continue to learn a lot of new things by working on Polygon and I can safely say that this is just the start. In the past, I have worked on a few other projects as well which you can find [here](https://github.com/basimsahaf). 

I am currently interning as a Software Engineer at [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com) in Toronto, where I am getting exposed to a lot of new technologies. In addition to this, the holistic approach to software at PagerDuty has encouraged me to learn about all the dimensions of software such as Product Management, User Experience and Sales. Prior to this, I worked at [Smart Technologies](https://home.smarttech.com) and researched at [University of Waterloo, Human Computer Interaction Lab](http://hcigames.com). 

When I am not doing the above, you will find me reading - particularly about history, politics, environment or social issues, while I am listening to [these](https://open.spotify.com/user/22bftaz6ri5f5dgwpkjfnhsba/playlist/6loVLbPVr6DKMZqxIjFoWx?si=2bgw3Lc2RfCYzUceny9zow) songs on Spotify. Apart from reading, I also love walking around new cities, finding and trying new food and visiting different cafÃ©s. 

Feel free reach out to me [here](mailto:bssahaf@edu.uwaterloo.ca) to talk about my interests or to just say hi ðŸ‘‹!
